# T-Bot
This is a Telegram bot coded with LUA running on this: https://github.com/davue/tg 
which is forked from this: https://github.com/vysheng/tg

Be warned, the code is quite chaotic, heavily adjusted for our special needs and poorly documented. Even if it's documented,
you may not be able to read it, because it's not english all the time.

So if you're a stranger, you most likely won't be able to use it.
